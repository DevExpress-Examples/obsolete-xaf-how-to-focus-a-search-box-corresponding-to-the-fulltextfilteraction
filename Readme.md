# OBSOLETE - How to focus a search box corresponding to the FullTextFilterAction, once a root ListView is opened in a Windows Forms application


<p><strong>============</strong><br><strong>This approach is obsolete. Refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q559647">How to set focus to a ParametrizedAction (Full Text Search) in code</a> article instead.</strong><br><strong>============</strong><br>This example demonstrates how to focus a search box corresponding to the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/clsDevExpressExpressAppSystemModuleFilterControllertopic"><u>FullTextFilterAction</u></a>, once a root ListView is opened. This may be convenient for some end-users wanting to start searching data instantly.<br> This solution supports both standard bars and ribbon interfaces, though a slightly different code is necessary for that.</p>
